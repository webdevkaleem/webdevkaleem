## ðŸš€ Current Projects (In Progress)
### 1. E-commerce Website Builder.
Iâ€™m currently developing an open-source e-commerce website builder similar to Shopify. This project features:
- An admin CMS for managing the storefront.
- Fully customizable storefronts through the admin panel, allowing users to tailor their online shops.

> Note: This project is still in its early stages and is not yet complete.

### 2. File Distributor
This project aims to facilitate file distribution among classmates without requiring account creation. Key features include:
- Admins can upload files for public download.
- All files are automatically deleted after 24 hours, ensuring privacy and anonymity.
- Aimed at helping classmates share files easily, especially for those without mobile access.

> Note: This project is also a work in progress and is not yet fully functional.
